Installazione app ReVanced per Youtube

Questa guida potrebbe non essere aggiornata.

In alternativa c'è questo [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/revancedextended/comments/1hs3w12/revanced_extended_guide_for_beginners/) su reddit che dovrebbe avere informazioni più recenti.

This guide is for non-rooted devices but should still work fine on rooted devices

Perform all of these steps from your phone.

This guide is for YouTube, but the same principles apply to other supported apps (see [here](https://github.com/revanced/revanced-patches) for the list of supported apps)

If you have downloaded a pre-built APK from a website offering them, it's not legit and may have been tampered with, so it's highly recommended to uninstall it and build your own APK using this guide

The official website for ReVanced is https://revanced.app which redirects to the ReVanced GitHub

### Download GmsCore, ReVanced Manager and YouTube APK:

1. Download and install GmsCore so you can log into your YouTube account (https://github.com/ReVanced/GmsCore/releases).  
   If you already have Vanced or inotia00 MicroG installed, uninstall it as you won't be able to update the new one otherwise

2. Download and install the latest [ReVanced Manager APK](https://github.com/revanced/revanced-manager/releases)

3. Download the latest recommended [YouTube APK (19.16.39)](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/youtube/youtube-19-16-39-release/youtube-19-16-39-android-apk-download)  

### Build YouTube ReVanced APK:

1. Open the manager, go to **Patcher** and tap on **Select an application** (https://i.imgur.com/HPdvkKr.png)
2. Select **Storage** in the bottom right (https://i.imgur.com/sYcGzgp.png)  
   You may be prompted to give ReVanced Manager access to your storage, so say yes to this
3. Select the YouTube APK you downloaded earlier (https://i.imgur.com/UIO99BP.png)
4. Tap **Selected patches** (https://i.imgur.com/nkx4tWd.png)
5. Tap **Default** to select the recommended patches (https://i.imgur.com/XC9YoSL.png)  
   You can turn patches on or off depending on what features you want
6. Tap **Done** (https://i.imgur.com/oFZNGZ1.png)
7. Tap **Patch** (https://i.imgur.com/NcnXqu0.png)  
   Wait a while for YouTube ReVanced to build (https://i.imgur.com/8BzPrPQ.png)
8. Once it's done, tap install (https://i.imgur.com/GpqgA0L.png).  
   You may get a warning saying the app isn't from the Play Store and needs to be scanned.  
   This is normal because the app is not from the Play Store.  
   You can safely ignore the prompt and continue to install.  
9.  Open YouTube ReVanced and log into your YouTube account

Done!

### Manager updates:

The manager will have a blue **update manager** button when an update is available.

Tapping this will download the update and prompt you to install it.

If this ever fails, follow this link to the [official manager APKs](https://github.com/revanced/revanced-manager/releases).

Download the latest APK and install it, updating your current installed version.

This should resolve your manager issues.

### YouTube ReVanced updates:

OK so you're patched and up to date, now what?

Keep checking back in the manager for updates every few days.

As this is an alpha, it's a little buggy, but over time this will improve.

For now, when you go to apply patches to your YouTube APK, make a note of the patch version displayed in the top right.

Chances are, you don't need to re-patch until there's an updated version.

So if it currently says the version is something like v2.143.0 and you patched to that, you're all good.

If you open the manager a few days later and it says something like v2.146.0 then it's probably a good idea to re-patch and update.

I believe the devs are implementing a feature at some point to show you what updates you're missing to prompt you to re-patch.

Again, this is an alpha and will improve over time.

### YouTube ReVanced crashes instantly when I open it:

It's likely that you downloaded and patched the wrong APK.

Ensure you download the APK that says [**APK** in grey](https://i.imgur.com/E3JOrLO.png).

Do not select the version that says **bundle** as this is the split APK and will not work properly.

Once you've done this, uninstall your current installed YouTube ReVanced.

Then follow the above steps again to build a new APK.

If this doesn't work, build the APK again using the **Recommended** patches option.

If you've done all of this and it's still not working, then post a thread here or on the official Discord server for support.
